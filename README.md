# Forkify — Recipe Search Application

Forkify is a modern JavaScript application that allows users to search for recipes, view detailed cooking instructions, adjust serving sizes, bookmark favorites, and upload custom recipes.

The project demonstrates advanced JavaScript concepts, asynchronous programming, API integration, and a clean MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture.

---

## Overview

Forkify fetches real-time recipe data from a third-party API and dynamically renders results in the browser. The application is fully client-side and built using modern ES6+ features and modular JavaScript.

---

## Key Features

- Search recipes using keywords
- Display detailed recipe information
- Adjust ingredient quantities based on servings
- Bookmark favorite recipes
- Persist bookmarks using local storage
- Upload custom recipes
- Pagination for search results
- Responsive and clean UI

---

## Technical Highlights

### MVC Architecture
The application is structured using the Model–View–Controller pattern:

- Model: Handles data fetching and state management
- View: Responsible for rendering UI components
- Controller: Connects model and view, manages application flow

### Asynchronous JavaScript
- Uses `async/await` for API requests
- Handles loading states and error management
- Implements modern Promise-based data fetching

### API Integration
- Fetches recipe data from an external recipe API
- Processes and transforms data before rendering

### State Management
- Centralized state object
- Bookmark persistence using Local Storage
- Controlled re-rendering for performance optimization

### Modern JavaScript Features
- ES6 Modules
- Arrow Functions
- Destructuring
- Spread Operator
- Optional Chaining
- Template Literals

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- External Recipe API
- Parcel (module bundler)

## Project Purpose

Forkify demonstrates the ability to build scalable, modular, and API-driven applications using modern JavaScript architecture and best practices.
